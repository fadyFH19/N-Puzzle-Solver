    "### Heuristics for n-Puzzle Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristics are used in search algorithms to estimate the cost from the current state to the goal. They don't give the exact cost but provide an estimate that can guide the search. The n-Puzzle problem, which involves sliding tiles on a board to achieve a goal configuration, can benefit from various heuristics. Below are three such heuristics explained in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Misplaced Tiles Heuristic (`h1`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanism:\n",
    "The misplaced tiles heuristic simply counts the number of tiles that are not in their goal position. This heuristic is admissible, meaning it never overestimates the true cost to reach the goal, as moving a misplaced tile to its correct position will require at least one move.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Manhattan Distance Heuristic (`h2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanism:\n",
    "The Manhattan distance is the distance between two points in a grid-based path (like Manhattan street grids) and is computed as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates. In the context of the n-Puzzle, it represents the minimum number of moves required to get a tile to its goal position, assuming no other tiles are in the way. For each tile, the distance is the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances to its goal position. The heuristic is the sum of these distances for all tiles. Like the misplaced tiles heuristic, this heuristic is also admissible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Disjoint Pattern Heuristic (`h3`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanism:\n",
    "The disjoint pattern heuristic divides the tiles into two or more groups, and for each group, it calculates a heuristic value (usually the Manhattan distance) as if the other groups didn't exist. By treating the groups as independent, the heuristic can be more informed than just considering each tile individually. The heuristic value for the state is then the sum of the heuristic values for each group. This heuristic can be more accurate than the previous two but is also more computationally intensive.\n"

    "The `is_solvable` function determines whether a given n-Puzzle configuration is solvable. Not every random configuration of the n-Puzzle is solvable. This function assesses solvability by counting inversions — instances where a tile has a lower value but appears before a tile with a higher value. This inversion count, combined with the board's dimensions and the position of the blank tile, can determine if a solution exists.\n",

    "### Mechanism:\n",
    "1. **Inversions**: The function counts how many pairs of tiles are in the \"wrong order\". If tile A comes before tile B, but A has a larger value than B, this counts as an inversion.\n",
    "2. **Board Dimensions and Blank Tile**: The position of the blank tile (or zero tile) and the width of the board play a role in determining solvability. The parity (odd/even nature) of inversions, combined with these factors, provides the answer.\n",

    "### Puzzle Solver (`solvePuzzle`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "The `solvePuzzle` function employs the A* search algorithm to determine the optimal solution for a given n-Puzzle configuration. It utilizes heuristic functions to guide the search, aiming to find the most efficient path from an initial state to the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mechanism:\n",
    "1. **Initial Checks**: The function initially ensures that the provided puzzle state is solvable. If it isn't, an error code is returned. Furthermore, the function checks that the provided state is a valid n-Puzzle configuration.\n",
    "2. **Heuristic Guidance**: The provided heuristic function estimates the h-cost. Different heuristics can result in variations in search performance.\n",
    "3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the goal state is reached, the function backtracks from the goal to the initial state to reconstruct the optimal path.\n",
    "4. **Astar Search**: The function explores potential successor states by moving the empty tile in various directions, always selecting the state with the lowest estimated cost to the goal (f-cost) as the next state to explore. This f-cost is a combination of the path cost from the starting state to the current state (g-cost) and the estimated cost from the current state to the goal (h-cost, obtained from the heuristic).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mechanism of A*:\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial state and compute its \\(f\\)-cost using the provided heuristic. This state is added to the frontier (a priority queue).\n",
    "2. **Loop Until Goal is Found**: The state with the lowest \\(f\\)-cost is always selected for expansion. If this state is the goal, the algorithm terminates.\n",
    "3. **State Expansion**: The `successors_maker` function generates successor states by moving the empty tile in all valid directions. For each successor, its \\(f\\)-cost is computed.\n",
    "4. **Path Cost and Heuristic Evaluation**: \n",
    "   - The g-cost for a successor is the g-cost of the current state plus one (since each move has a cost of one).\n",
    "   - The h-cost is computed using the provided heuristic function.\n",
    "   - The sum gives the \\(f\\)-cost for the successor.\n",
    "5. **Update Frontier**: If a successor state has not been explored or if a better path to it is found (a lower \\(f\\)-cost), it is added to the frontier.\n",
    "6. **Avoid Revisits**: States are marked as explored after expansion to prevent redundant exploration. The explored set also helps in pruning paths that have higher costs to already explored states.\n",
    "7. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the goal state is reached, the function backtracks from the goal to the initial state to reconstruct the optimal path.\n",
